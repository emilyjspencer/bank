## Technologies & Design Principles

The app has been written using the Ruby programming language and tested using the
RSpec testing framework.

I have used a test-driven approach to create the application.

## Specification

### Requirements
* You should be able to interact with your code via a REPL like IRB or the JavaScript console.  (You don't need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.)
* Deposits, withdrawal.
* Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
* Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).
